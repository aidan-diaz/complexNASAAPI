## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JS

An application that fetches the latitude and longitude from all NASA locations (https://data.nasa.gov/) and uses that data to make a fetch request to (https://www.weatherapi.com/). This allows the site to display the current weather in Fahrenheit for all NASA locations.

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me to be cautious when making requests to free APIS - it is worthwile to take time to find an API that allows a larger number of requests per day.
